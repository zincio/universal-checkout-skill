# eBay Checkout

Buy, track, and return products from eBay (ebay.com) through the Zinc API (`https://api.zinc.com`). US orders.

> **Powered by Zinc Universal Checkout.** The same API buys from eBay and 50+ other US retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, eBay, and more). To order across multiple retailers from one skill, install the [`universal-checkout`](https://github.com/zincio/skills/tree/main/skills/universal-checkout) skill (`npx skills add zincio/skills --skill universal-checkout`). Live retailer list: `GET https://api.zinc.com/retailers`.

## Quick Start

**Which auth method should I use?**

- **`ZINC_API_KEY` env var is set** → Use `POST /orders` with Bearer token auth. This is the standard flow for pre-registered users.
- **`TEMPO_PRIVATE_KEY` env var is set** (or user wants to pay with crypto) → Use the MPP `/agent/*` endpoints. No account needed — pay per call with on-chain crypto: `POST /agent/orders` to buy, and `/agent/search` to discover ($0.01 per data call). `GET /retailers` is free.
- **Neither is set** → Ask the user to either sign up at <https://app.zinc.com> for an API key, or provide a funded Tempo wallet key.

All amounts are in **US cents** (e.g. `5000` = $50.00).

## Authentication

### API Key Auth

```
Authorization: Bearer $ZINC_API_KEY
```

### MPP Auth (Machine Payments Protocol)

MPP uses a challenge-response flow — no API key needed upfront:

1. Send `POST /agent/orders` with no auth → receive HTTP 402 with payment challenge
2. The `pympp` client library resolves the challenge automatically (signs and submits an on-chain transaction)
3. The request is retried with payment credentials → HTTP 201 order created
4. Save the `X-Api-Key` response header — use it as a Bearer token for `GET /orders/{id}`

The `pympp` `Client` handles steps 1-3 automatically. You just make one `client.post()` call.

## Find a product (optional)

If the user already has a eBay product URL, skip to **Place an order**. Otherwise search for one:

```bash
curl "https://api.zinc.com/search?q=cast+iron+skillet" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZINC_API_KEY"
```

`GET /search` returns `{ status, query, results: [...] }` across retailers; each result has a directly **orderable `url`** plus `retailer`, `title`, `price` (cents), `stars`. Filter results to `retailer == "ebay"` for eBay-only, then pass the `url` into an order.

Paying with crypto (MPP, no account)? Use the metered `GET /agent/search` instead — $0.01 per call, returns a `Payment-Receipt` header; the `pympp` `Client` handles the 402 → pay → retry automatically. `GET /retailers` is free.

## Place an order — `POST /orders` (or `POST /agent/orders` for MPP)

**Required fields:**

- `products` — array of product objects (see below)
- `shipping_address` — US delivery address
- `max_price` — integer, the **maximum total in cents** Zinc may spend before finalizing (your price ceiling)

**Product object:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | string | ✓ | Direct eBay product page URL (on ebay.com) |
| `quantity` | integer 1–100 | — | Units to buy (default 1) |
| `variant` | array of `{ label, value }` | — | Options, e.g. `[{ "label": "Size", "value": "Large" }]` |
| `condition_in` | array | — | Allowlist of acceptable conditions |
| `condition_not_in` | array | — | Denylist of excluded conditions |

**Condition enum:** `New`, `Refurbished`, `UsedLikeNew`, `UsedVeryGood`, `UsedGood`, `UsedAcceptable`.

**Shipping address:** `first_name`, `last_name`, `address_line1`, `address_line2` (optional), `city`, `state` (2-letter), `postal_code`, `phone_number`, `country` (defaults to `US`).

**Optional order fields:** `handling_days_max` (integer ≥1 — cap on seller handling time, the lever for bounding how fast it ships), `is_gift` (boolean — suppress prices on the packing slip), `idempotency_key` (string ≤36 chars), `metadata` (object), `po_number` (string).

### Controlling price & shipping

There is no shipping-*method* picker; control cost and speed with: `max_price` (price ceiling), `condition_in` (allow used/refurbished for a cheaper qualifying offer), and `handling_days_max` (cap handling time).

**Order statuses:** `pending` → `in_progress` → `order_placed` | `order_failed` | `cancelled` | `cancelled_by_retailer`.

**Example (API key):**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.zinc.com/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZINC_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "products": [{ "url": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/256123456789", "quantity": 1, "condition_in": ["New"] }],
    "max_price": 5000,
    "handling_days_max": 5,
    "shipping_address": {
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "address_line1": "123 Main St",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "postal_code": "94105",
      "phone_number": "5551234567",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }'
```

### Paying with crypto (MPP) — `POST /agent/orders`

Same request body, no API key. Agent pays `max_price` upfront via crypto deposit; a `$1.00` API fee is reserved (bot spends at most `max_price - $1`). On success: charged `actual_price + $1`, remainder refunded via Stripe. On failure: full refund. The HTTP 201 response includes header `X-Api-Key` (a `zn_live_...` Bearer token for status checks) and `Payment-Receipt`.

```python
# pip install pympp
from mpp.client import Client
from mpp.methods.tempo import tempo, TempoAccount, ChargeIntent, CHAIN_ID

account = TempoAccount.from_key("0x<your-private-key>")
method = tempo(chain_id=CHAIN_ID, account=account, intents={"charge": ChargeIntent()})

async with Client(methods=[method]) as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "https://api.zinc.com/agent/orders",
        json={
            "products": [{"url": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/256123456789", "quantity": 1}],
            "max_price": 5000,
            "shipping_address": {
                "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe",
                "address_line1": "123 Main St", "city": "San Francisco",
                "state": "CA", "postal_code": "94105",
                "phone_number": "5551234567", "country": "US",
            },
        },
    )
    # Client handles the 402 → pay on-chain → retry flow automatically
    order = response.json()
    api_key = response.headers["X-Api-Key"]  # use for GET /orders/{id}
```

For testnet, import `TESTNET_CHAIN_ID` and pass it as `chain_id`.

## Track & manage orders

### Get order — `GET /orders/{id}`

Retrieve a single order by UUID (Bearer token: `ZINC_API_KEY` or the MPP `X-Api-Key`). The response includes `status`, `items`, `shipping_address`, plus:

- `tracking_numbers` — array of `{ id, carrier, tracking_number, created_at }` (carrier e.g. `ups`, `fedex`, `usps`, `amazon`). Added automatically; there is no separate tracking endpoint.
- `job_result` (once terminal) — `success`, `error`, `error_type`, `estimated_delivery`, `merchant_order_ids`, and `price_components` (`subtotal`, `tax`, `shipping`, `total`, `currency`).

```bash
curl https://api.zinc.com/orders/<order_id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZINC_API_KEY"
```

### List orders — `GET /orders`

Returns `{ orders: [...] }`. Requires Bearer token auth.

### Cancel order — `POST /orders/{id}/cancel`

Cancels an order **only while `pending`** (still queued); once `in_progress` or done it can't be cancelled. Returns `204 No Content` on success.

## Returns — `POST /returns`

Open a return against a placed order (Bearer token auth).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `order_id` | UUID | ✓ | The order being returned |
| `items` | array of `{ order_item_id, quantity }` | ✓ | Items to return (`order_item_id` comes from the order's `items`) |
| `reason` | enum | ✓ | `damaged`, `not_delivered`, `empty_box`, `wrong_item`, `defective`, `not_as_described`, `wrong_size`, `no_longer_needed`, `forced_cancellation`, `other` |
| `notes` | string ≤2000 | — | Free-text detail |

**Response (201):** `{ id, order_id, status, reason, items, label_urls, merchant_return_id, ... }`. Return `status`: `open` → `approved` | `denied` | `credited`. Ship via the URLs in `label_urls`. Also `GET /returns` and `GET /returns/{id}`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.zinc.com/returns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZINC_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "order_id": "8c2d...",
    "items": [{ "order_item_id": "a1b2...", "quantity": 1 }],
    "reason": "damaged",
    "notes": "Arrived with a crushed corner."
  }'
```

## Error Handling

See [references/errors.md](references/errors.md) for the full error code reference.

Key points:

- HTTP errors return `{ error: { code, message, details } }`
- Order processing failures appear in the order's `job_result.error_type` field
- Common issues: `max_price_exceeded`, `product_out_of_stock`, `invalid_shipping_address`
- MPP payment failures return HTTP 402 with `{ error: { code: "payment_failed", details: { reason: "..." } } }`
- HTTP 402 without `payment_failed` code means the server is issuing a payment challenge (normal MPP flow — the `pympp` client handles this automatically)

## Order Status Tracking

Orders process asynchronously and typically take **5–10 minutes**. After placing an order:

1. Wait ~7 minutes, then poll `GET /orders/{id}`.
2. If still `pending` or `in_progress`, poll again in 3–5 minutes.
3. Stop polling when the status is terminal.

**Terminal statuses:** `order_placed`, `order_failed`, `cancelled`, `cancelled_by_retailer`
**Non-terminal:** `pending`, `in_progress`

If your platform supports scheduled tasks or cron jobs, schedule a check ~7 minutes after order creation rather than polling in a loop.

## Safety

- **Always confirm with the user** before placing an order (`POST /orders` or `POST /agent/orders`) or opening a return. Orders spend real money.
- Reading operations (search, `GET /orders`, `GET /orders/{id}`, `GET /returns`) are always safe.
- Validate that `max_price` is reasonable before submitting.
- MPP orders charge the agent's crypto wallet — ensure sufficient balance before placing.

## Retailer notes

eBay supports fixed-price (Buy It Now) listings — pass the ebay.com item URL. Auction listings aren't supported.
